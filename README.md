# Personal-Projects
A repository of some projects made by me:

Ballistics Computer: Accounts for the curvature of the earth; rotational inertial effects, and super-sonic drag using a step-wise integration scheme

ScatteringSMX: An example of code I've written for the NANOGrav collaboration - This is a timing component to model a time-varying scattering effect on timing data

Eigmap Small Thetas: An example of a small investigation I made into the eigenvector decomposition method currently used to calculate scintillation waveforms
