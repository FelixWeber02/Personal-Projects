# Sample-Projects
A repository of some projects made by me:

Electrostatic Sim: This was my final for Phys 290 Computational Modeling – Using known charge densities it calculated the electric potential of a given system through relaxation and multi-grid solving. 

Ballistics Computer: A personal project made in my free time – Accounts for the curvature of the earth; rotational inertial effects, and super-sonic drag using a step-wise integration scheme.

ScatteringSMX: An example of code I've written for the NANOGrav collaboration - This is a timing component to model a time-varying scattering effect on timing data for PINT.

Eigmap Small Thetas: An example of a small investigation I did for a research project with Prof. Dan Stinebring in late 2021. I focused on the eigenvector decomposition method currently used to calculate scintillation waveforms, specifically on the case of fine structure scintillation.

Gaussian Process Primer: This is a simple walkthrough of how gaussian processes can be used to fit for non-white processes, showing what inputs are required and what calculations are being actually done.

N-Body Harmonics: This demonstrates how using discrete approximations of 1D to 2D bodies allow us to easily compute the resonant harmonics of the system through eigenvector decomposition. In the 1D case, assuming constant densities, this results in the standard harmonic wave solutions; in 2D this can be used to find the resonant harmonics of any specified shape (e.g. squares, circles, rings, etc.). The same approach can be used in higher dimensions but is not demonstrated here.
